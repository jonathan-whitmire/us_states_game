# us_states_game
How many states can you name?

# This is an app game built with turtle graphics. The app is a picture of the United States and a text box. The text box asks 
# the name of a state, has an input bar, and two buttons (ok, cancel). The player types in a name into the input bar. That answer is 
# checked against an existing .csv list using Pandas. Pandas also creates a list of states to learn if the user is unsuccessful naming all 50.
